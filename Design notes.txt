Swordfish swims around at beginning and end of levels (can rotate camera) but as soon as the swordfish swims through a ring, the level begins and the camera is locked, and you can only move forward.
Ring provides speed boost? (Base swim movement is slow?) Slow and fast swimming animations.
Small fish are afraid on swordfish in the early levels, but when garbage gets picked up, they dance and have notes above their heads
First two levels, let player know how to swim and dodge, swim through rings (first five levels?)
Different environments in first five levels, coral reefs in a level, underwater shipwrecks in a level, third level is coral reefs but less lively, closer to human activity. Water color slowly becomes greener. (Fourth level with underwater volcano?)
End of fifth level, Spike meets an oil barrel leaking into the sea, as a cutscene.
Sixth level, Spike passes through first barrel, moves on, less lively coral, fewer schools of fish, from sixth to tenth level. Examples of fish suffering from human pollution.
Spike taught other fish how to deal with human garbage. 
Beak can break human garbage, if interact button is pressed soon enough.
Beak gets covered by garbage, shown in cutscene later at the end of the tenth level.
From 11th to 15th level, friendships from other fishes are shown, from 16th to 20th level, still destroying garbage, but we meet a big ship. Game ends before 25th level.
